This is a story about the worst shower I've ever used, which made it the worst shower I ever had.

I was visiting in Berlin this past summer staying at a really cool hostel on the west end. The people were great, the food was great, but the showers were horrible. They were so bad that the design has been permanently burned into my memory.

The shower consisted of the following three components:

1. The shower head
2. Dial for temperature control
3. Motion sensor to turn the water on/off

You may be thinking, that's not that bad, seems like a normal shower. That's the thing though. The worst part may be that it seems like a regular shower until you start to use it.

The problem? The motion sensor. The same sensor turns the shower on and off. I don't know anyone who stands perfectly still while showering, which means the water keeps stopping and starting, even while drying off.

Things from Germany things are normally really well thought out, so it really caught me off guard when this shower was so poorly designed.

Please think through your designs. Everything you make matters.

This is a scene from one of my favourite movies. I find that it perfectly depicts how users react when a design fails and whenever I need to design something I keep this scene in mind.

This is what happens when fear, panic, or frustration set in and when users lose trust in what you've built, whether it's an elevator or a web application. These reactions are real and I've seen variations of this scene too many times to count.

- My mom when using an app on her iPad, panicking when she can't read the UI.
- People at my office when their computer won't connect to the dock.
- My friend when failing to sign in to an app on their phone
- Everyone when the TV remote doesn't work.

People react in different ways:

- Frantically search for a workaround.
- Suddenly become illogical and forget everything you've taught them.
- Become frustrated, or angry, and maybe even violent, probably towards you.
- Shut down and walk away from the object, never to use the object again.
- Or if you're lucky, they stay calm because they know exacatly what to do.

Your users have put a certain amount of trust in you and your app and you as the designer need to cherish this trust. The users are the ones in a vulnerable position and if you're too harsh with them, they will leave.

Whether you're building an app, planning an event, or teaching a new subject, your job is to make sure that fear impulses never kick in. I'll end with a quote that has really stuck with me over the years. "Design everything."

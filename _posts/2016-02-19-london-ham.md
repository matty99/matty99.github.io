# London Ham

I didn't know this but ham is heavily ingrained in the British culture. Everywhere you go there is ham, being offered or sold. People in their community are even famous for their feats of ham. Because of this, I decided to have a proper ham day on Wednesday. I started off the day with a ham and cheese sandwich and packed one up in my bag for lunch as well and off I went! I hopped into the tube and soon enough I arrived at Buckingham Palace.

Called Buckingham because their ham had a little bit of a kick to it. I shouldn't say little. I got a small sample and it's like being kicked in the stomach by a bull. I can't say I wasn't warned, it's right in the name. After you get past the initial shock, the smoked ham just falls apart in your mouth. Brilliant! It's no wonder this family is famous across the lands, and even considered royalty some parts. The palace is their production facility, a wonderful old building embroidered with lots of gold all over, a sign of their successes, surrounded by a large 10 foot iron gate and heavily guarded by large men in uniform carrying hefty machine guns. One must protect such a successful family secret. Their recipe has been passed down for many generations, and probably many more to come. Unfortunately I was unable to enter the grand building, but I'm not too bothered. I have lots of other things to get to today. Next up, a massive ham festival.

A festival so big, there are three tube stops dedicated for just this purpose. Clapham North, Clapham South, the north and south entrances to the festival, and of course Clapham Commons, smack dab in the middle of the annual Ceremonial Ham Clapping Festival. Clap your ham, a friends ham, a strangers ham, even clap two hams together. A very loud and joyous festival, filled with lots of eating, beer drinking, singing, and of course ham claps that can be heard miles around. The clapping tenderizes the meat so you get that wonderful "fall apart in your mouth" element to the hams. There are prizes given out throughout the festival for the largest ham, the tastiest ham, and the best sounding clap.

Just to the north of the festival is the little region of Balham. A monumental discard pile crawling with foxes where they've balled up, and chucked out all the ham that didn't survive the clapping. It's a shame that there is so much discarded ham, however, with a festival this big there is bound to be some waste. At least the local critters are benefiting from this.

And what better way is there to end a long day of eating and walking than a large feast with friends. Everyone plays a part in preparing the meal. I personally was in charge of the salad. I chose a nice kale salad with cranberry raisins and pumpkin seeds coated with a regional red wine vinaigrette, thinking the sharp zing of the vinegar would compliment the orange chutney coated ham, and sure enough the group loved it. For desert, small pig shaped chocolates reminded me a bit of Easter bunny chocolates we have back at home. The kids were put to bed and we enjoyed nice conversation by the bonfire until about midnight.

I hope you enjoyed this little venture inside the massive ham culture in Britain.
'Til next time! This is Mr. Stork, signing off.

Approximate price: $1.50  
2 packets - 1 vegetable, 1 soup base

I was expecting a tomato based soup because at first glance I thought the vegetable on the cover was a tomato, but upon closer examination it turns out it's a big ol' mushroom and I'm in for a spicy ride. You'd think the red packaging would have tipped me off...

Whenever you open a ramen packet there are a few loose noodles that fell off from the main bundle. I have a habit of snacking on these while preparing the bowl. This time they are really yummy! Lightly salted with an almost buttery flavour. Reminds me of eating popcorn at the movies.

Now cooked, the noodles continue to be really good. Really chewy and bouncy. Lots of fun to eat and every bite has me craving another mouthful of noodles.

After trying the noodles it's time for the broth. Fuck that's spicy. First spoonful got me right in the back of the throat. I think I can safely say this is on the upper end of spice levels for ramen packets I've tried.

Beyond the heat that the soup brings, there wasn't much going on in terms of flavour in this soup. Not really my style of soup, although I was big fan of the mushroom that came in the vegetable packet. Would recommend for anyone who wants to clear out their sinuses, but would opt for other soups for a quick snack.

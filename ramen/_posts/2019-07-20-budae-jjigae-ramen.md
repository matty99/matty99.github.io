Approximate price: $2.00  
3 packets! - 1 meat and vegetable, 1 powdered soup base, 1 liquid soup base / sauce

After a short break to Japanese packets, it's time to go back to a few more korean ramen - the easiest type to find in Toronto.

When I open ramen and check how many topping packets there are I feel like a kid again shoving my hand to the bottom of the cereal bag to see what toy was included in the pack (back when they still did that), or opening a kinder surprise, or a pack of pokemon cards. That anticipation around how many packets and what types will be included always gets me going. The topping packet is nice because it adds some variety to the soup, but it's not what you're getting excited over. When you see two soup packets is when you start to feel like you've struck gold. Did they accidentally drop too many in my bag? I got two rare cards!? Woah. The assembly of the soup also becomes that much more exciting. I start to feel like I'm doing a mini science experiment. Like the first time you combined baking soda and vinegar. You have to realize there was a reason they couldn't mix packet A and packet B together. They are entrusting you with the difficult task. And, yes, most of the time it's to avoid sogginess of some kind, but part of me always hopes that I'm creating an explosion of some kind when mixing the two (explosion of flavour of course). With 3 packets included, you know my hopes are high for this soup.

The raw noodles are crispy and light at first but then quickly starts sticking to your teeth. Any sticking usually indicates the noodle is going to be chewy once cooked, which I'm looking forward to, but unfortunately any sticking is a con for me while snacking.

Lots of fun little floaties floating around. What look like hot dog slices are actually spicy fish cakes. The beef tastes like nothing or is overwhelmed by the soup broth, it does have a fun squeeky texture though.

The noodle is chewy and curly, but flavourless. It gets coated in the spicy oily bits but not all that much of the soup. The pairing has room to improve.

The broth has more of a fishy feeling than a flavour that's coming through. Sort of an odour of fishiness. If you can imagine a spicy version of fish stock LaCroix (someone explained to me that drinking LaCroix is like drinking soda water and having someone yell the name of a fruit from the other room, I find this an apt comparison here). I've noticed that Korean ramen often play with the concept of "hot as a flavour", but if you compare this hot to the classics like shin cup, then the hot is a mellow boring.

I had really high hopes for this soup considering the 3 packets I put in, but I may have hyped it up for myself too much. I'll give it that something about the way the soup tastes is filling, despite not having a strong flavour, and it has a warm burn at the back of the throat that is not overwhelming.

It wasn't hard to finish the bowl because it wasn't overly salty, or spicy, or....anything. On the other hand, maybe that's what this soup has going for it. No super overpowering flavours, lots of fun floaties, and probably works well with additions.

If you end up with this soup, I suggest having fun with it. Add your own egg, tofu, enoki mushrooms. Treat it like a hot pot. Channel your inner army stew.

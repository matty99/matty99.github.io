Approximate price: $1.50  
1 packet - liquid soup base

This is the first pack I'm reviewing that I received as a gift, it is not, however, the first pack I've received as a gift (surprisingly enough, I have a lot of cool fans in my little niche community). Full disclosure, the only reason I'm doing this one first is because of the best before date on the package. For precision's sake, I'll mention here that I'm reviewing the mini version since it is crucial information for you to know.

Due to me receiving this as a gift, the approximate price is even more approximate this time around.

Another note, if you happen to be following this blog very closely and trying all the ramen along with me, you may have a hard time finding this one outside of Japan. Apologies for the inconvenience hyper fans.

First thing to mention, I didn't try the noodles raw this time. When they come in a cute bowl like this I don't like to mess with the noodles, coercing them out of the bowl, breaking off chunks, and then putting it back in the bowl. I just feel a bit bad doing it is all. It being a mini pack also convinced me not to do it. I will mention though, when first opening the package I saw some veggie pieces and meat chunks, I'm excited to try those once everything is boiled.

All cooked! It's a mini size but this thing is full of noodles - I'm talking to the brim. This is my first ever duck soup ever. Here goes the first slurp.

The noodles are really soft. It is a soba noodle, but I don't think that's why. I maaayyyy have overcooked them. Oopsies.

Broth has a really bright and light taste, tastes a lot like a hot version of zaru soba - the classic cold dipping soba dish. The soup coats and pairs with the noodles really well. I'm having a really hard time describing this flavour, maybe because it's so new to me. I've taken about 10 sips and I still can't quite find the right words to describe it. A little bit soy sauce, a little bit katsuobushi, with the duck fat coming in at the end really nicely just lightly coating the noodles, and then your lips.

The soup comes together really well. A delicious snack. Just be careful of the noodle cooking time (a lesson from my mistakes).

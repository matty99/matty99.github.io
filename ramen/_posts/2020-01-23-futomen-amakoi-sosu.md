A little bit of a break since the last review, my apologies super fans for the delay. There are times in the year where I'm eating way too much in terms of junk food and large meals to justify opening up a pack of ramen. It feels like I spent the back half of the year just eating.

Today's review is for another saucy noodle rather than the usual soup. It came in a fancy box, which I will respect in the same way as I usually do and skip the dry noodle tasting section. While on the topic of fancy boxes this one is particularly fancy. It seems to me the designers are showing off their skills a little bit on this one. The cooking instructions suggest pouring boiling water into the container, letting the noodles sit and cook for a bit, then to pour the water out, and then add the sauce and toppings from there. The package cover is quite sturdy and has a cut out section with small holes poked into the lid. This acts as both a steam vent while cooking the noodles and a strainer when pouring the water back out. Very cool!

All cooked. Let's try some noodles!

Wow! It tastes and feels like I'm eating a warm soft okonomoyaki. The sauces are similar, the noodles are super soft and spongey like an egg would be, and there are even pieces of cabbage I'm biting into from time to time. Everything pairs really nicely. Of course, these pairings are tried and proven from many other dishes so I'm not completely blown away, although I am impressed with how well all these flavours do in an instant style dinner.

I put the whole pack of mayonnaise and I'm starting to regret it. I happen to not be the biggest fan of mayonnaise out there and the creamy acidic taste is dominating the dish and I was barely able to appreciate anything else. Depending how much you like mayo, especially one that resembles kewpie mayonnaise, my recommendation to you would be to use this packet as a lever. If you were to rank mayo as a flavour on a scale from 0 - 10, then I would use that score to determine how much of it to put on.

Overall, it was fun to eat the fluffy noodles and had familiar textures and tastes that were very pleasant.

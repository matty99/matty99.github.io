Approximate price: $0.35  
3 packets! again - 1 split packet with chili powder and soup base, and 1 oil / fat looking thing

Alright Mama, show me what you got! We're back at the bottom of the price ladder. This could easily show up be in the cheapest 5 ramen packets in Toronto. I wouldn't be surprised if it was first (or last?). At 35 cents it reminds me of the good ol' days before the $16 dollar bowls hit the restaurant scene. Let's jump in.

Noodles raw are absolutely magnificent. Light, crispy, and well seasoned. This could be a pack of chips! No sticking to the teeth, lots of flavour. They taste like they have been cooked in some sort of chicken flavoured oil. I could eat the whole pack as a snack, but I will resist...for now. Maybe the next pack.

Let's not dwell on the 3 packets this time around. It's hard for me to imagine that this 35 cent packet can live up to my mad scientist dreams anyhow. That said the raw noodles were great and I'm excited for the whole soup to come together.

After forcing myself to stop snacking, I've managed to boil the noodles and add the packets to create a soup. Yay me.

The noodles are firm, not chewy, Fun curly things they are.
the soup lightly coats the noodle

Strong forward flavour. Nails the artificial chicken flavour. By the way, I love how this soup doesn't try and be a chicken flavoured soup, but just owns the artificial aspect of the chicken flavour. They aren't trying to fool anyone here, they just say it how it is. The broth is salty and a bit sour/acidic which balances out with the oiliness and meatiness really well. A good level of heat, just enough to keep things interesting. There's no denying it, this is the processed cheese of the ramen world. Just how processed cheese can barely call itself cheese, this soup can barely call itself chicken flavoured (and so they don't).

Mama mia that's some good soup! I love it. It completely blew away my expectations. Beyond just the soup itself, this ramen packet demonstrates an incredible amount of engineering expertise. Just think about all the factory line optimizations this team had to go through to drop the cost of production of one ramen packet down to the point where it is still profitable at 35 cents. It's really quite incredible when you think about it (and even when you don't, it's still incredible).

Do try this soup. It's cheap, it's quick to prepare, it's yummy, it's snackable.

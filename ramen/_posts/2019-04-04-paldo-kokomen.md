I was supposed to be trying the noodles raw before each review, but I had a mouthful of cooked noodles the moment I remembered this. Oh well! Look forward to this section in the next review.

The first thing that strikes me about the soup before even trying it is the smell. A warming jalapeno aroma with a strong chicken smell. Ramen packets don't normally smell this yummy.

Noodles are really chewy and lots fun to slurp. No where near the bottom end of noodles, but lacking a little something from becoming a top tier packet noodle.

Floating around I see chilli peppers, green onion, and chicken bits? Whenever I see meat in a ramen packet soup I'm always a bit surprised and a little relieved at the same time. Sort of like an "Oh! They used real ingredients to make this!"

That strong jalapeno flavour comes through in the first bite, reminiscent of a bag of Miss Vickie's chips, backed by a lingering familiar and nostalgic chicken noodle soup flavour. I say nostalgic because when I was growing up, whenever someone in my family was sick they would get a bowl of Lipton chicken noodle soup. It's that same familiar taste with the added light heat from the jalapenos. A very comfortable bowl for me to eat, probably because of how used to the taste I am.

All in all the soup doesn't scream "Drink me!" and it's not spicy enough to clear out your sinuses, so I would use it as a fun alternative to the non-spicy version, that is, if you have the same tradition I had growing up. Not as salty as most packets out there, but still pretty salty. Probably had me drinking an extra half to full glass of water afterwards to re-hydrate, which is quite low given the average.

A fun throwback.

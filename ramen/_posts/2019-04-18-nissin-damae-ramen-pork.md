Now that I've written and released two reviews, it's time to give you a little introduction and tell you what this is all about.

When I'm out shopping for groceries, often I will grab a ramen packet, among other such things, for a quick meal if I'm ever in a pinch for time during the week. One day I was standing in the ramen section for quite some time humming and hawing over which packet to take. I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I knew which ones were the good ones and worth that buck or so that you end up spending on them, and which of them you're much better off just never trying in the first place? There was a basket sale for 88 cent nissin ramen and I thought, what better place to start than the low end of the ramen price ladder? I grabbed one of each flavour and here we are reviewing the pork.

You might be wondering what even makes me qualified to be a food reviewer. I wish I could say I have a lot of experience in the food industry or something like that, but that's not the case. I do go out for food a lot and tend to be a tough critic on food, but I'd hardly be fit to critique the fine dining scene. I'm just a ramen lover who loves talking about food.

We had to come up with some standard method of going through the ramen packet experience which, due to my childhood snacking habits, will start with me trying the noodles raw.

These noodles were very much the standard mass-produced basic noodle. Not the most fun to eat, and not much else to say about them.

Then we assemble the soup, mention anything that comes up during that - such as cooking complexity or aromas, and then try the noodles once cooked.

The noodles continue to be very standard, however they swelled up and absorbed a lot of the soup flavour which made them really quite enjoyable to eat.

Now the broth alone, followed by any notes about eating the broth and noodles together.

I was pleasantly surprised by the soup. Part of this probably came from my prejudice of eating an 88 cent packet of ramen, but it really is quite yummy. One negative while eating the soup is that a certain oily note really sticks out, and I will go ahead and say it's just too oily. Ramen tends to do well with a good amount of fat, it just does need to be the right kind of fat. The oil seems to be just some kind of basic canola that's shown up just by accident, possibly from the deep fried noodles. Beyond that, the soup does mimic a tonkotsu broth really quite well. I do say mimic though, because it's missing a certain fullness to the flavour. I'd bet if you somehow managed to get a fuller, more authentic taste to the broth, it would do quite well in Toronto's restaurant ramen scene.

Finally, we summarize the experience and mention any afterthoughts. This is often where I comment on the salt and MSG levels in the broth because by this point I've usually finished the bowl which is when I realize "oh my! that's a lot of salt I just had there". I might mention some toppings that I think might pair well with the soup, but I always eat the packet without adding anything extra in as I've decided to critique the product for what it is, not what it could be.

In this packet the soup was really enjoyable, as I mentioned, and if I only had slightly better noodle quality I would probably be grabbing this one all the time. For 88 cents, and I'm beginning to see them even cheaper, this is a great grab. A thought I had about improving that oily taste would be to boil the noodles separately from the soup, have the oils come out in the water, and then get them in the soup. A bit more effort, but might bring about a bit more joy.

There we have it. The layout of the review, surrounding the actual review of the Nissin Ramen. I hope you'll join me for more.

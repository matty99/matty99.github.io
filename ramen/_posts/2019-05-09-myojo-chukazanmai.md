Approximate price: $2.00  
2 packets - 1 soup base, 1 liquid soy seasoning

Eating noodles raw was definitely not something the creators of this product ever thought to do. They are really hard, flossy, and not enjoyable in the slightest. Not a snack time ramen. Do not try at home. Another thing that occurs to me about these noodles is that they probably won't be fit for the quick boil method (i.e. adding boiling water to the noodles and letting them sit). This may be the first pack I've had that I need to treat like a proper soup and boil before eating. Actual food-like preparation steps! Can you believe it? What a drag.

Noodles are firm and quite unlike the usual ramen packet noodles. Surprisingly similar to what you would get in a Toronto restaurant in terms of texture if you requested the thin noodle option.

When trying the broth, the first tastes are salty and oily. Neither of these are so overwhelming such that you would reach for a glass of water or something else to clear your palette, but they are prominent flavours. Similar to how if you drank a tomato soup, the first flavour in your mouth would hopefully be a "Bam!" of tomato. I'm cautious to use the word umami because I don't think that it is well understood as a flavour, but that is the idea I'm reaching for.

There's a reaction the tongue has when it is overwhelmed by salt, you can try this one at home. Pour some salt in your hand, wet a finger in the other hand, dunk it in the salt and place it in your mouth. Unless you just polished off a bag of chips, your reaction will likely be "Mmm yum salty!" If you do this again, you may still get the same reaction, but likely the second or third time you will begin to experience the salt flavour negatively. Your face will scrunch up, and you'll feel like "Ugh! That's gross." I'll remind you at this point that you have been putting the same thing in your mouth over and over, not changing the substance in any way. What I'm getting at is there are diminishing returns on all the flavours we experience, salt being the easiest one to show as an example. When one hits this point while eating a dish the descriptor that is reached for is "too" as in too salty, too sweet, too much.

Now back to the broth, this broth is very salty. I experience the saltiness as an overwhelming majority of the flavour. However, it manages to do this without me feeling that it is "too" salty. The oil is there, but it is not too oily, and it's not an offensive flavour like in some broths. Granted, by the time I am further than a few spoonfuls into the bowl I might have a different opinion. Not the most complex broth, but it's pretty nice actually.

The noodles do a great job pairing with the soup. They get coated nicely in the soup and deliver all that soy flavour into your mouth with that fun noodle texture. Garlic would go great with this soup, just a nice grated ball of it on top, and a soft boiled egg, and green onions, and... I mean probably any topping would go well with this soup. That's not to say this soup doesn't hold up on its own, just that it's reaching to be a meal and not just a light snack.

Now time to finish the bowl and the soy saltiness is getting to me, it's a bit much at this point. I suppose I predicted this would happen. A bit hard to finish the bowl, bring a glass of water or two with you to this adventure. The annoying this is, I'm craving more. This may be the first packet I've had where I've wanted another bowl of it afterwards, usually they fall quite flat at this point. Definite recommend. Prep some toppings for the optimal experience.

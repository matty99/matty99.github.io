Approximate price: $1.50  
3 packets - 1 soup base, 1 chili oil, 1 egg block

The company seems to have a standard noodle that they are using in all their packets. Lucky for us it's a pretty solid noodle. It makes sense from a business efficiency standpoint, however it leaves us with a repetitive review. Light, popcorn-like, and no taste of oil or odd after taste. Once cooked the noodles have a glossy texture, and a nice chew.

The thing to talk about this time around seems to be this glorious egg block. They've gone as far as bringing special notice to it, exclaiming "Contains Egg Block" on the front of the package. It fell apart a lot like cracker or a piece of bread would in a soup, which seems to be the theme with these cute extras like tofu, egg, or others. The dehydrated egg doesn't hold a candle to the plump juiciness a real egg block could bring to this bowl and leaves me longing for something fresh. It seems to have absorbed a lot of the sesame and chili oil as I get a real kick of heat whenever I put even a little piece in my mouth.

The broth has that classic korean spice we've had around forever. It's a lot like the classic nongshim shin ramyun (which I will likely review one day), the soup that started it all for me. The heat hits you in the back of the throat and the heat gets more intense the more you eat. I like the floating veggies quite a bit, the leak especially add a nice touch of texture to the mix. This soup, unfortunately, doesn't have a whole lot more than that classic spice going for it. I could barely taste the sesame flavour once the egg block was gone.

We will classify this as another curious case of the boring spicy soup.

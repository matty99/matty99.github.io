Approximate price: $1.50  
3 packets again! - 1 soup base, 1 cheese powder, 1 dried veggies/toppings

This is the third 3 packet ramen in a row! It's a triple packet hat trick! Well done everyone. We fricken did it.

Let's start off by addressing the elephant in the room. Cheese ramen. Yea that's right. This is going to be a weird one I think. The cheese packet looks like KD powder as I pour it, and tastes pretty similar too. I'm not sure what to think or expect, but discomfort is usually a good when it comes to food. If not during the meal, then the aftermath where you feel happy you tried something new and relieved that it's over. Regardless of what happens, this cute cheese hat wearing ottogi mascot is putting me at ease.

Really dry noodles. The moment you pop them in your mouth they start to suck up any and all moisture there is. There is an odd flavour that gets released once you've chewed on the noodles, probably of the oil they were fried in. Has kind of a plastic flavour that makes me think of those giant plastic jugs of canola oil, but it could be any oil, I'm just throwing out wild guesses here. No real taste beyond that slightly unpleasant one.

The soup is now ready to be slurped and it's a muddy orange colour. I suppose that's what happens when you mix red chili powder with the cheddar powder. Here goes nothing!

Soft and spongy noodles that have absorbed some of the broth. It's always a positive when the noodles pair up with the soup in some way, and the spongy texture goes really well with the cheesy taste. Think of a fresh neapolitan pizza with it's soft chewy crust and how it goes so well with that buffalo mozzarella on top. I mean, it's a proven combination, no surprises here, and I'm glad they are making use of it here.

Broth has a mild spice that just tickles the back of your throat on the way down, and warms the edges of your tongue as you have more of it. They've got some interesting earthy herbs in the broth that add a nice dimension of warmth and coziness to the experience. Possibly oregano and marjoram, but don't take my word on that. Once again leveraging the cheesy bread combinations that italian dishes have been doing for years. If you take the cheesiness out of the equation, it still tastes like there is a reasonable full tasting broth here, though it's hard to make out quite what it would be like. I just got a little bit of corn in my spoonful that was floating around. I'm so glad it wasn't crunchy because it goes well with the sponginess of the noodles while it's soft like this.

There's no legacy behind this soup that I know of. Cheese, I believe, is a fairly new thing in eastern cuisine, so it's hard to imagine a famous cheesy soup that this packet is pulling inspiration from. For me it's fun to try and imagine what a pro would do with a dish like this if they were making a refined version, or even a diner level dish. I think the cheese in the broth would make it hard to elevate, it just seems like a difficult thing to get right. Then again, I've had some pretty spectacular queso dip.

All the veggies sunk to the bottom, so I got a nice big mouthful of toppings near the end of the bowl. I'm thinking it was soft carrots and broccoli bits.

All in all not as weird as I was expecting. The cheese powder stayed distinctly separate to me from the rest of the soup, that is to say it tasted/felt like it never dissolved fully into the broth. I think if you poured KD powder into a any solid ramen packet broth that you would achieve a similar result. I did enjoy it, and appreciated the flavour of it all, I just never really acquired a taste for KD. A mac and cheese lover might have a really good time eating this soup. The pairings were all well thought out, from the noodles, to the veggies, to the herbs in the soup, and much more. They did pretty well with this soup, it's just not really jiving with me is all.

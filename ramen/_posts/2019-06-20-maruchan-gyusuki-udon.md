Welcome to another best-before date forced review. These deadlines are turning out to be good motivators.

I skipped the raw taste test again for the same reason as last time, I feel bad compromising the integrity of the bowl. I see raw bits of veg, tofu, and beef rattling about. I look forward to trying those.

Let's go through the components!

Udon noodles. Really fun, soft noodles. They still have some bite to them, so they aren't turning into mush or disintegrating in your mouth. They've absorbed some of the sweet broth while cooking in the bowl which they pair well with. While eating this I can imagine myself slurping down a version with freshly made noodles. Filling my mouth with way too many udons, cheeks full, each of them a body pillow for a different part of my mouth.

The broth is sweet yet savoury. Reminds me of a teriyaki sauce. If you've had kitsune udon before, this is like a sweet beefy version of that broth. A touch of oil, just enough to coat your lips.

The dried beef bits have a funny taste to them probably due to the method used to dry them out. Initially they taste juicy and beefy but it's followed quickly by the taste of old sock. If it weren't for this off taste the texture is surprisingly good and it would be much like enjoying a juicy slice from a fresh bowl of gyudon or something alike.

I'm please by the tofu bits. It's a bit like soggy bread floating around the soup, and that could be a good or bad thing. You know how when you're dipping your biscuits in tea and you're waiting for that perfect moment just before the biscuit breaks off and you're left with a soggy clump floating around the bottom of your elegant teacup? That's how I would describe the tofu. Some people resent that soggy clump as it reflects their failure in agility, others embrace it as a great alternative form to enjoy the biscuit in. Love it or hate it, this soggy tofu brings me joy.

The dish as a whole calls out for the fresh ingredients version more than any other packet or bowl of instant noodles I've had before. It reminds me of the feeling of sitting in an udon shop, the soft supple noodles filling your mouth, the sound of slurps all around you, and then you get pulled back to where you are. Eating a bowl of instant noodles.

Beyond the broth it doesn't hold a torch to the real deal, but it's impressive that I can have an experience that transports me while eating instant noodles. We've really moved up a few tiers from noodles I normally eat.

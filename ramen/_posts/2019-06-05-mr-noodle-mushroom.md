Approximate price: $0.75  
1 packet - powder soup base

When I was in middle school there was a convenience store right by our school where we would go for our freezies and other junk food. Back then we would eat Mr Noodles like bags of chips. We would crush up the noodles in the bag, take the seasoning packet and sprinkle it over everything, and then chow down. Despite this nostalgic attachment to the brand, I will do my best to remain impartial. If it's any consolation, I've never had this flavour before.

They're really dry, and extremely floury to the point of having a grainy texture. On the bright side, they aren't oily at all unlike most brands. After trying the noodles raw I started questioning what I was thinking as a kid eating these instead of chips. Maybe Mr Noodle has changed his recipe since then. In any case, I do not recommend snacking on these raw.

Bad news, when cooked the noodles don't really lose that floury taste and grainy texture. I feel a bit let down.

The soup is really light, has a nice mushroom flavour and it's not in your face about it. Ramen is all about umami though, so I feel like this soup took things in the wrong direction. The broth isn't very salty, another thing I like, which means I don't need to chug as much water afterwards. Nothing special to say about the combination of the noodles and broth together, it doesn't feel or taste like a well thought out pairing.

Not a fan of this one. Wouldn't even consider it a strong vegetarian option. On to the next bowl.

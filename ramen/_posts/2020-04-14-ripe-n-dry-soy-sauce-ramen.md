What better thing to do during a global pandemic lockdown than to catch up on ramen reviews? Hello ramen fans, I'm back from a hiatus with another special pack from my japan shipment. Today I have for you a very aggressive looking shoyu ramen.

This is probably the first time in this series that I haven't followed the fast boil method and actually followed the instructions on the packet. I pulled out a pot and everything. I know! I'm becoming super proper. This packet was closer to the experience of a dry saucy noodle than a soup so I opted for a proper boiling and straining of the noodles. What am I doing? I don't need to explain myself. Rules are meant to be broken!

I was instructed to leave some of the noodle water behind when preparing the noodles, and as I'm coating the noodles with the soy sauce packet I see there was some fat in the sauce as well. These two things together made for a much creamier sauce than I was expecting.

First taste, the texture of the noodle catches my attention. Pretty similar to a restaurant quality noodle, reminds me of the sun noodle brand that's used in ramen shops all over Toronto.

Tons of depth in the flavour, and the creaminess keeps coming through. The noodles are coated in the sauce evenly and it's helping them stick together oh so slightly. The fat is adding a wonderful dimension to the flavour, and an addicting quality to the seemingly simple looking dish.

It's possible you would get overwhelmed by the soy sauce taste and not be able to finish the dish, it sort of depends what you're looking for from a bowl of noodles. It doesn't taste like the soy sauce you get with takeout sushi that got poured into some noodles, it's much more than that. If you give it a chance, treat it like a wine and let it sit on your palette a little while, I think you'll be pleased.

Having this kind of pack all the time I think would be a bit much, but once in a while it would be quite a treat. Especially given the number of spicy packs out there. I guess what it comes down to is I would definitely have it again.

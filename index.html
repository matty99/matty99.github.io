					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						That's me over there on the right, your left. Well, it's not really me, it's a picture of me. 
						I'm not sure I had to mention that as it is a website about me and things that I have done. 
						It would be odd if I built an entire site and then used someone else's picture. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, I'm finishing up a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto and I've become that guy. 
						The guy that people talk to when: their computer is slow, when they need any web-related help, when the campus wi-fi stops working, when they forget their netflix password, when their vaccuum or dryer isn't working....you get the idea.
						When I was 13 I learned HTML and CSS, and built my first static website.
						Since then I have been fiddling with websites and I really got into web development in university.
						Soon after I was making the website for the orientation week, then redesigning the student council site, and now I'm attempting to freelance.

					<p>
						<strong>University College Orientation (2013)</strong> - This is my
						third effort at this website. You can see my past efforts on the <a
						href="past_works.html">past works</a> page I'm currently working on
						the registration and payment process using Stripe and hope to move
						on to design shortly. I'm thinking about playing around with some
						frameworks, specifically Django.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Stock Target Prices</strong> - This is a web start-up that a
						friend of mine started. It aggregates financial projections of
						analysts. In the early stages of the project I worked with the tool
						in charge of database control to increase efficiency of the site and
						while adding new functionality to the tool. I help out where I can
						from time to time. <a href="http://stocktargetprices.com/">Take
						a look</a>!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Computer Graphics (2013)</strong> - ....
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Toronto Tennis Camp (2012)</strong> - I had a month to
						refresh the look of a camp website. I met frequently with my
						supervisor to ensure the content was modified quickly and precisely
						to their liking. You can see the finished product on my <a
						href="past_works.html"> past works</a> page.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Search Engine (2012)</strong> - Worked in a team of five to
						develop a request for proposal (RFP) search engine that was hosted
						live on a free web server. Unfortunately it has been taken down now.
						The crawler portion of the search engine was written in Java and it
						prepared the database entries. The web portion used PHP and MySQL to
						provide search results based on keywords found within the documents.
						For the project we used a scrum-like development cycle.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Search Engine (2010)</strong> - In a team of four we created
						a Java-based Faculty Member search engine using the Scrum
						development technique. The program crawled a provided list of
						websites and displayed search results in a Java UI.

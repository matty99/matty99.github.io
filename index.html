					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						That's me over there on the right, your left. Well, it's not really me, it's a picture of me. 
						I'm not sure I had to mention that as it is a website about me and things that I have done. 
						It would be odd if I built an entire site and then used someone else's picture. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, I'm finishing up a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto and I've become that guy. 
						The guy that people talk to when: their computer is slow, when they need any web-related help, when the campus wi-fi stops working, when they forget their netflix password, when their vaccuum or dryer isn't working....you get the idea.
						When I was 13 I learned HTML and CSS, and built my first static website.
						Since then I have been fiddling with websites and I really got into web development in university.
						Soon after I was making the website for the orientation week, then redesigning the student council site, and now I'm attempting to freelance.

					<h1>Projects</h1>

					<h3>Current Projects</h3>
					
					<h4>Developer Profile</h4>
					<p>You're looking at it. That's right, this site. Built with Bootstrap, so it's responsive. It's open source. It's ongoing.</p>
					<br>

					<h4>jShuffle</h4>
					<p>
						I've finally found my way of connecting with the open source world. 
						JShuffle will be a responsive animation/game using CSS3 for animations. I welcome you to <a href="https://github.com/matty99/jShuffle">follow my progress!</a>
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Stock Target Prices</h4>
					<p>
						A web startup that a friend of mine started that aggregates financial projections of analysts. 
						In the early stages of the project I worked with the Python tool in charge of database control. 
						The project was recently migrated to Django
					</p>
					<p>Currently I'm completely redesigning the front end and should be live sometime in February. <a href="http://stocktargetprices.com/">Stay tuned!</a></p>
					<br>
					<h4>The Chemistry Experiment</h4>
					<p>
						This is the project I'm most excited to see flourish. It is going to be an open source Python project that will simulate interactions between atoms. 
						It's gotten so wild that I've begun exploring quantum physics. 
						I'm still in the planning and research stage but when I finally start coding you'll be able to watch it on <a href="https://github.com/matty99/">my github.</a>
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Orientation 2014</h4>
					<p>
						I worked on the past 3 orientation sites so chances are they want me to do this one as well. 
						I need to ensure that I'm learning something new in the process, otherwise the task will just be muscle memory. 
						My goal would be to use <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> to better organize myself and of course <a href="https://stripe.com/ca">Stripe</a> to manage payments.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Past Projects</h2>
						<h4>University College Orientation (2013)</h4>
						<p>
							My third effort at the orientation website. 
							Once again I had someone from the frosh week team helping me with the design but worked alone on everything else. 
							Continued to use HTML, CSS, and jQuery for the front end, and PHP, MySQL for the back end.
							I upgraded the registration and payment process to use Stripe instead of Paypal which allowed for a much simpler sign up process. 
							Online registration brought in about 650 applicants, summing to over $50,000 in gross income. 
							Half way through the summer I had to migrate the project to a designated server while continueing to accept online payments. 
							Naturally, there was tons of testing involved in this process. 
							The site is still live so feel free to <a href="http://www.ucorientation.com">poke around.</a>

						<h4>Ray Tracer (CSC418 2013)</h4>
						<p>
							Worked with a partner to develop a C++/OpenGL ray tracer for a class project. 
							Throughout the semester we were introduced to advanced computer graphic techniques to produce the best possible 3-d computer generated scenes. 
							For the final project we had to implement all the algorithms we learned and produce our own custom scenes.
							Below is a sample generated image from our final product.

						<br>
						<h4>University College Orientation (2012)</h4>
						<p>
							My second effort at the orientation site. This time I worked with an artist to design the front-end, but besides that I worked alone. 
							The applicants filled out a custom form integrated with Paypal which was linked to a MySQL database. 
							Successfully registered over 500 applicants online, bringing in over $40,000 for the frosh week team.

						<h4>Toronto Tennis Camp (2012)</h4>
						<p>
							I had a month to fix up a summer camp website and update the content.
							There were frequent conversations with my supervisor to ensure the content was modified quickly and precisely to their liking. 
							During this project I focused on site search engine optimization (SEO) and page load times.
							<br><br>

						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>Search Engine (2012)</h4>
						<p>
							Worked in a team of five to develop a request for proposal (RFP) search engine that was hosted live on a free public web server. 
							The crawler portion of the search engine was written in Java and it prepared the database entries. 
							The web portion used PHP and MySQL to provide search results based on keywords found within the documents.
							For the project we used a scrum-like development cycle within our team to ensure efficiency and coordination.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>University College Orientation (2011)</h4>
						<p>
							This is my first ever live website. I designed the site on my own with the use of HTML, CSS, and Photoshop.
							It contained information for incoming first-years about the events taking place during the first week of school as well as registration information. 
							Through this work I got my first exposure to managing a server and working with clients to keep site content up to date.

						<h1>Extras</h1>
						<p>
							I love to laugh. As I browse the web I save any cool or funny pictures I find. 
							Here are some of my favourite comic strips and images.

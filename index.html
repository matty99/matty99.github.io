					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						That's me over there on the right, your left. Well, it's not really me, it's a picture of me. 
						I'm not sure I had to mention that as it is a website about me and things that I have done. 
						It would be odd if I built an entire site and then used someone else's picture. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, I'm finishing up a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto and I've become that guy. 
						The guy that people talk to when: their computer is slow, when they need any web-related help, when the campus wi-fi stops working, when they forget their netflix password, when their vaccuum or dryer isn't working....you get the idea.
						When I was 13 I learned HTML and CSS, and built my first static website.
						Since then I have been fiddling with websites and I really got into web development in university.
						Soon after I was making the website for the orientation week, then redesigning the student council site, and now I'm attempting to freelance.

					<h1>Projects</h1>

					<h3>Current Projects</h3>
					
					<h4>Developer Profile</h4>
					<p>You're looking at it. That's right, this site. It's responsive. It's open source. It's ongoing.</p>
					<br>

					<h4>jShuffle</h4>
					<p>
						I've finally found my way of connecting with the open source world. 
						JShuffle will be a responsive animation/game using CSS3 for animations. I welcome you to <a href="https://github.com/matty99/jShuffle">follow my progress!</a>
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Stock Target Prices</h4>
					<p>
						A web startup that a friend of mine started that aggregates financial projections of analysts. 
						In the early stages of the project I worked with the Python tool in charge of database control. 
						The project was recently migrated to Django
					</p>
					<p>Currently I'm completely redesigning the front end and should be live sometime in February. <a href="http://stocktargetprices.com/">Stay tuned!</a></p>
					<br>
					<h4>The Chemistry Experiment</h4>
					<p>
						This will be an open source Python project that will hopefully simulate a chemical reaction between atoms.
						I'm still in the planning and research stage but when I finally start coding you'll be able to watch it on <a href="https://github.com/matty99/">my github.</a>
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Orientation 2014</h4>
					<p>
						I worked on the past 3 orientation sites so chances are they want me to do this one as well. 
						I need to ensure that I'm learning something new in the process, otherwise the task will just be muscle memory. 
						My goal would be to use <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> to better organize myself and of course <a href="https://stripe.com/ca">Stripe</a> to manage payments.

					<h3>Past Projects</h2>
						<h4>University College Orientation (2013)</h4>
						<p>
							This is my
							third effort at this website.  page I'm currently working on
							the registration and payment process using Stripe and hope to move
							on to design shortly. I'm thinking about playing around with some
							frameworks, specifically Django.

						<br>
						<h4>Ray Tracer (CSC418 2013)</h4>
						<p>
							Worked with a partner to develop a  C++/OpenGL ray tracer. 
							Implemented advanced computer graphic techniques to produce computer generated 3-d scenes of the highest quality. 
							The final scene included recursive ray tracing to secondary reflection,  light sources of varying colour, and objects with a wide range of material types.

						<h4>Toronto Tennis Camp (2012)</h4>
						<p>
							I had a month to refresh the look of a camp website.
							I met frequently with my supervisor to ensure the content was modified quickly and precisely to their liking.

						<br>
						<h4>Search Engine (2012)</h4>
						<p>
							Worked in a team of five to develop a request for proposal (RFP) search engine that was hosted
							live on a free web server. Unfortunately it has been taken down now.
							The crawler portion of the search engine was written in Java and it
							prepared the database entries. The web portion used PHP and MySQL to
							provide search results based on keywords found within the documents.
							For the project we used a scrum-like development cycle.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h4>University College Orientation (2011)</h4>
						<p>
							This is my
							third effort at this website. You can see my past efforts on the <a
							href="past_works.html">past works</a> page I'm currently working on
							the registration and payment process using Stripe and hope to move
							on to design shortly. I'm thinking about playing around with some

						<h4>Search Engine (2010)</h4>
						<p>
							In a team of four we created
							a Java-based Faculty Member search engine using the Scrum
							development technique. The program crawled a provided list of
							websites and displayed search results in a Java UI.

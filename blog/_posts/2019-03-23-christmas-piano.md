Haven't done this  
in ages. Let's check the pace.  
Quarter note 60 that means  
slow not a race.

Sit up nice and tall with a hand on the page.  
Check that posture again, I hear it worsens with age.

The title is clear, the mood has been set. It's time to get started...  
*&lsaquo;&lsaquo;smile and inhale&rsaquo;&rsaquo;*  
Yes let's

This story's about a swell, loving boy who wanted this year to buy more than a toy.  
He searched far and wide for a gift for his dear, even checked the fridge for ideas - just a single cauliflower ear.  
"I'll get her a piano" he thought to himself, "and maybe some groceries to restock these shelves"  
Waltzed into town, bounced into a store, browsing the options he kept looking for more.  
Online he found a seller, a boy young was he, who had up for a sale a wonderful piece.  
"Finally I've found it! This looks like the one. I'll just go pick it up and then I'll be done."  
Got in the car, allegro down the road, he hoped to bring it back into his humble abode.

"Does it still work? Does it still sing? Does every note still ring the right ring?"  
"It works just fine! I'm simply switching careers. Saving for a PC to start streaming new year."  
"Would you like to hear a song?" as he started to play,  
"Moonlight sonata? That seems wrong. The sun is still out."

*&lsaquo;&lsaquo;instrumental interlude&rsaquo;&rsaquo;*  

"Thank you young sir, I'll take the whole set"
"Excellent mister! She'll love it, I'll bet"

He drove everything back, and parked out front. Now to get it inside, a bit of a stunt.  
Takes a quick peek home to make sure no one's in, then right back downstairs with a mighty big grin.  
Piece by piece he brought up each part, had gotten it down to somewhat an art.  
Stocatto downstairs, he was having a ball, lento back up to avoid major fall.

The scurrying was over, everything in place. As she stepped in he prepared to showcase.  
Standing upright and tall, two octaves for smile, he sight read this fugue, sharing it all:  
"Accept this gesture, although maybe not grand, it's a keyboard to play on and learn on again"  
Let it be known, the gift struck a chord - "You got me a piano?" She cried out, floored.

Now dropping an octave, resolving the dissonance, this story's not all cute fuzzy innocence.  
Remember the fridge? It remained mostly bare. The sad fridge, voice shivering "All I wanted was a pear"  
So this holiday season, I ask you, please remember this rule: remember your friend who keeps your food nice and cool.

You know what really grinds my gears? Just kidding.

I came across the no-smell compost a while back now and have wanted to write about it ever since. To me the invention is infamous because I saw my roommate affected by its bad design.

The smell-free compost bin - gone is that lingering funky kitchen smell you've grown tired of. That's right, they actually came up with a way to absorb the smell of rotting food. The trick is....well, hold that thought because I don't actually want anyone to do this.

Why not? Why do I want your kitchen to smell like rotting bananas and that sour unpleasant nostril tickle of rotting food scraps? Quite simple. It promotes good behaviour. Here, allow me to explain.

One of the surprising things about it is how good the concept seems to be. On the surface it's solving a very common, almost fundamental problem associated to the idea of compost. Underneath that top layer though, it may actually be changing your habits for the worse.

Let's walk through an example with the regular full-smell edition of the compost receptacle. From the moment you put the first piece of food, like an orange peel, into the compost bin or bag you've got about 4 days before it starts exuding that familiar aroma (this estimate doesn't really come from anywhere beyond my own experience so don't quote me on it). On that fourth day you probably also start to notice that smell in your kitchen and you think to yourself, "Hm, I should take that out." You proceed to take the organics out to your bin outside, or wherever you normally would.

That's it. Plain and simple. Now the new anti-smell version.

From the moment you put the first piece of food, like an orange peel, into the compost bin or bag you've got about 4 days before it starts to smell bad...inside the bin. You see the lid has this really cool carbon felt thing which kills all odors on the spot, so that odour never leaves the bin. On day 6 you have a few more scraps to throw in. "Ugh that smell. I hate that smell! Hm, but it's not quite full yet. I want to be efficient as possible with this bag, plus organics isn't collected for another few days." On day 9, you kitchen still smells great. You just made your favourite garlic onion butter thingy and damn...it smells yummy. Time to chuck those onion peels, "Oh right I really should take that out, it's really starting to smell bad" Day 15, "Hey roomie, why'd you just throw out that organic thing into the garbage even though you're not supposed to? We have an organics bin right there!" You put on a troubled face. You agree with them, you really want to be sorting your organics correctly but dealing with that organics bin has turned into an ordeal. Every time you open it that smell in the kitchen lingers for a few minutes, and it's not full enough to take out yet, and if you do take it out now it's going to smell really really bad, like really bad, and there's going to be that garbage juice at the bottom, that stuff that stains the roads every garbage pick-up day, and.......damn I really wish I took this out sooner.

Well, why didn't they take it out sooner? They were so responsible in the first version of your story! Well it's quite simple actually. The answer lies in the signals.

Compost has two signals that we use to indicate we have a chore to do. First is the smell, and the other is the fullness of the bag. The first one makes you want to get remove the stuff from your kitchen ASAP, and the second forces you to replace the bag. You can't keep composting if the bin is full. Both signals work independently of each other to notify you that there is an errand to be done.

One of the signals involved is not the most pleasant you could say. In the first example it works by making you avoid it as much as possible. If you happen to slip up and forget to take out the bin, you are reminded with a very potent smell the next day. This is negative reinforcement at it's finest. You put a fresh bag in and you vow to do better to avoid the smell from happening again next time.

In the second example, this signal, this negative reinforcement is moved to be associated with something very different - the opening of the bin. When you open the bin you get a waft of bad smell. Do this enough and you might start noticing you are avoiding that bin altogether. You start throwing things out that should be in the organics, or in an extreme case you might change what you eat on a particular night so you aren't creating organics messes.

The same signal used in a different (and wrong) way ruined the whole design of the product. It created an organics bin that deters people from using organics bins.

Take a look at designs around you, or the designs you've made, and be on the lookout for anti-smell compost bins lingering about. Your good intentions could be training bad habits.

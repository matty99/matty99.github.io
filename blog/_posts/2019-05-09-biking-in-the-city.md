If someone is trying to convince you biking to work in Toronto is something you should be doing, there are a few things you should know first. Yes, it's extremely cost efficient, yes, it keeps you in shape, and yes, it is pretty damn fun, but it's far from easy in a city like Toronto. My goal is not to deter you, far from it, I would love it if more people biked to work. I aim to inform you so you can stay safer during your adventures.

I have been biking in Toronto since I was very young - to school, to the beach, daily to work, as a courier, you name it. I was raised a city biker, and I hope I always am one. Luckily I haven't had very many close calls in my days, but I think my approach to the road have prevented most of the issues I might have had to face.

The following list is not ordered and not complete by any means, in fact I intend to come back and add to it / edit it over the course of the summer biking to work some more. My recommended approach to reading the list is going over a few notes, practicing to apply them, and coming back for some more. I will mention a lot of things that may be quite obvious, but I expect people of many levels to come by this page which means not all things are as obvious to them as they are to you.

So here goes - tips and tricks I learned from my many years biking around downtown Toronto, and road etiquette for city bikers to follow. Notes on etiquette help keep bikers around you safe, and car drivers around you calm and informed.

1. Cars have priority over bikes. Why? For the same reason trucks have priority over cars. Cars are bigger than bikes and if there's a collision you will get hurt, but the car driver will be perfectly fine. Yes, they may have a hefty bill on their hands, but they won't have a trip to the hospital followed by physiotherapy (best case).

 - If a car is beside you and you're coming up on a side street, give the car some extra space. You don't want to get cut off. It's best not to count on them to check their blind spot.

 - Beware of people hailing cabs or waving down their uber, it could mean you're about to be cut off by a car. I like to throw in a quick shoulder check whenever I see someone waving on the edge of the curb.

 - Every once in a while parking lots will hire flag people to advertise parking space. Sometimes a flag is so enticing it makes drivers forget to check their blind spot.

1. It's safest to assume the cars beside you can't see you or don't know you're there. Drivers often move to switch lanes before checking their blind spot, rather than vice-versa (a.k.a. the recommended approach). Even on days when I can keep up with the cars on the road, but I make a point to not drive beside them for this very reason.

1. Don't drive beside trucks or buses. You're increasing the chances you aren't seen in someone's blind spot.

1. Stop for streetcars! Pedestrians already aren't fans of city bikers, no need to enforce the stereotype. If they are walking out and you cut them off or scare them you aren't doing us any favours. Besides, it's the law to stop. You could really injure someone.

1. Bikes don't have any rear view mirrors and usually don't have side mirrors.

 - When passing another biker give some sort of signal to the biker. A bell, a whistle, or a "On your left!" all work fine.

 - When passing you need to give extra space, because even though you let them know they still might not know you're coming.

 - When slowing down to pull over you need to signal to bikers behind you. This prevent you from creating a collision.

1. There's a "slowing down" hand signal - shown as elbow out, hand down on your left side. It's a good idea to look around before you try pulling over as well. Imagine you are walking behind someone on the street and they quickly stop to tie their shoe, same idea. Your goal is to not mess with the pace of the bikers and drivers behind you.

1. Often when you hear a bell it means another biker wants to pass you. Move over to the right side of the lane, as much as you can while still staying safe, to give them more room to pass. I suggest throwing in a shoulder check before moving back over to the left side of the lane in case it's a 2 or 3 bikers that wanted to pass.

1. When passing another biker, imagine there's a sewer grate, a ditch, or a door swinging open that the biker needs to avoid while you pass. Leave enough space for them to avoid the possible hazard, plus enough for some elbow room while passing. This keeps everyone comfortable on the road.

1. Do not pass other bikers on intersections. Intersections are one big hazard. Just wait until after the intersection if you need to pass.

1. Pretend every parked car is about to swing its door open. There's no harm in taking up a bit more room on the road, it doesn't disrupt drivers in the lane beside you. It also keeps you safer by giving you more time to respond in the case where a door does actually happen to swing open. I often suggest hugging the outside of the bike lane, unless someone is trying to pass you, for this reason.

1. Breaks are the only way you can stop, unless you have a fixed gear bike. That means in some situations your life can depend on those levers there. Learn to tune your breaks and check up on them at least once a week. An Allen key is often all you need.

1. Make sure your tires are pumped. This all depends on the weather and how you bike but a good baseline is to check up on them once a week. It will save you a bunch of money on pinch flats and punctures. It also uses less energy to bike when your tires are pumped up, because you lose less speed and momentum to friction.

1. Always ride perpendicularly over streetcar tracks. Bike tires are often the perfect width for getting stuck in those things. It's not worth the risk.

1. Avoid driving over sewers, they are quite similar to streetcar tracks as a hazard.

1. Always pay attention to potholes. They are an easy way to get a flat. Also a great way to injure your wrist and hurt your bum.

1. On wet roads, puddles can indicate a pothole. Avoid them to avoid bruised wrists from the impact of your handlebars or more annoying would be a pinch flat.

1. Beware ice! Beware snow! I personally don't bike if there's any ice or snow on the ground because I'm scared of my tired slipping and wiping out.

1. Beware gravel! Gravel, to a thin wheel, is a lot like ice. When more sparse it can be an easy way to puncture your tire on your way to work.

1. Construction zones often contain a whole lot of loose gravel. When wet, they are an easy way to splash your pants and backpack with mud and ruin your outfit.

1. If you are leaving your bike somewhere, especially overnight, make sure your wheels, seat, and light are secured.

1. Wear a helmet. If you are someone who bikes frequently and doesn't wear a helmet already there is likely very little I can say to convince you to do otherwise, I know this because I used to be that person. I'll try anyways. They feel annoying, they aren't stylish, but if you ride enough, a day will come when you'll be thankful you had one. Trust me on this one.

1. At night, it's a good idea to stick to main roads. Main roads are well lit and cars respect the lines a lot better since they often aren't in as much of a rush.

1. If you're riding at night and you're planning to be on side streets rather than main roads, it's a good idea to have bike lights. One for oncoming traffic so they stay on their side of the lane and know to avoid you. One for cars behind you so you don't pop out of nowhere and so they give you enough space while passing.

1. If you're biking at night, take up more room than you would during the day. On side streets there is no reason you shouldn't be dead center of the lane to increase your visibility for cars.

1. Enforce good behaviour on the road! People like acknowledgement and it makes it more likely the behaviour will continue in the future.

 - If a person driving a car makes extra room for you, gives you right of way, waits for you to pass before turning right, doesn't rush a left turn, or generally does things conscious of you on the road, then you should acknowledge it! I throw in a nice smile and a patented "thank you wave" whenever something like this happens.

 - If you particularly enjoy biking behind someone else because of how they command the road or how much they signal, let them know!

1. When riding downhill it's a good idea to go slow enough that you can still stop if something funky happens.

1. When riding downhill stay at a controlled speed. There are often still driveways or side streets that cars are pulling out of that you'll need to avoid.

1. When going downhill and the road is turning, make sure you have extra space towards the turn. Centripetal force will make it so your bike gets pulled one direction or another.

 - If the road turns left, your bike will drift left towards the center of the road.

1. On a red light at an intersection, line up behind other bikers unless you're making a turn AND you can make it to the intersection and perform your turn before the light turns green.

 - Imagine the light turns green and you are to the left of a few bikers that want to go straight, while you want to go through their lane to go right. It's a messy situation that you want to avoid.

1. If you need to perform a left turn you should pretend you are a car. Signal that you're merging, wait for an opening in the left turn lane, change lanes, and then stick to the middle of the left turning lane while you wait to turn. Clear the intersection as quickly as you can.

  - Hold your hand signal while in the lane waiting to turn if there are no cars behind you to inform new cars what you are doing. As soon as there is a car behind you there is no real need to hold your signal any more.

  - Do not hold your signal while turning, it will only slow you down from clearing the intersection in a reasonable amount of time, and you might need to do a quick maneuver while turning.

1. That's a lot of left turn notes, which brings me to this - the best left turn is no left turn. It's better to get off your bike and walk two light changes like a pedestrian would. Much easier and less stressful for everyone.

Let's say you were given the opportunity to run a school cafeteria. Being your dream for the longest time you quickly quit your job and apologize to your boss but insist that this incredible opportunity you stumbled upon only happens once in a lifetime.

You arrive on site and everything looks a bit dusty, like it hasn't been used in a while. You whip out a fresh pack of elbow grease and get cleaning. You polish every nook, cranny, and corner you can find. You hire up a fresh staff who are eager to get started and train them up. The old slum is starting to look like a brand new corvette, now you just need students.

You convince the school principal to let you speak at the next assembly and announce the grand re-opening of the school cafeteria. The plan works and you get a healthy flow of growling stomachs the next day. Watching the place run is like a factory churning out smiling students out the doors, one after another. Your hard work and dedication is paying off.

A few months in and you notice you are beginning to be a bit strapped for cash. Although running smoothly, the cafeteria is only breaking about even. It's time to start iterating. You hunt down articles around the web about raising profit margins and decreasing costs. You start measuring which students are coming in and what they buy. You start to notice some trends and think it's best to start optimizing around these different types of students.

The first type of student you take special notice of comes in near the end of lunch, they've already eaten but are looking for something a little bit more to top them up. They usually spend a lot of time looking around and making up their mind. Often they come up to the counter a few times with various items but they usually end up putting a lot of the items back, sometimes even leaving without buying anything. You decide to try your luck with these types of customers.

You train your cashiers to notice these situations and how to persuade the customer that their purchase is the right choice. You implement tap debit making checkout extremely quick and easy. With these two changes in place you quickly notice these customers are seemingly more sure of their purchases and rarely leave without buying anything any more.

At your end-of-month meeting the staff bring to your attention that the amount of stock you've assigned to each day is being used up. It makes sense, you think to yourself, the sales our up so our stock should reflect this change. Over the next little while you keep track of what is being used up and what isn't and is being wasted. Turns out that vegetables are hardly ever bought and are a cause of a lot of waste at the end of the day, meanwhile snacks and treats are selling out almost every day and have a much longer shelf life. Naturally, you react by increasing your snack stock and slowly cutting out the vegetables on sale. It wasn't your decision, the customer voted with their purchases after all.

I end the story here. You've managed to flip a business from certain doom to a profitable one. You move on with your excellent business sense to run a few other successful companies and live a wonderful, successful, fulfilling life.

What's the morale then? That is for you to decide. You might read this story and think the main character had excellent business sense and so anyone, given enough hard work and dedication, can also react to what their customers are doing and turn a profit and be successful in their own business. If you're like me on the other hand, you'll think twice about the successes gained here and after reading this you'll feel the immense weight of responsibility drop on your shoulders.

For those who still need a little help seeing my side of things - What does your ideal customer look like? Do you fear for their health or well-being? Do their impulsive shopping habits make you think green or hang your head in shame?

Every action has a reaction. Optimize wisely.

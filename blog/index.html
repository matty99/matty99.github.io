This is a work in progress, the pages don't look the same yet.

The decision to not go with a server
- Huge unecessary handicap. It was to save money, but it could've just shared a server with another app, it didn't need a dedicated server.

The contact form
- There was a decision made to not have a server, and simply build the site in aws buckets. The contact form submission was hacked in.
- It would literally be 1 php file to send an email

Templates populated by ajax calls
- Slows down initial load time
- This is something that should be compiled as a partial on the server side, not hacked out on a static site in the browser
- The reason to do this was in order to manage team members better. As people moved around or left they could be managed from one json file.
- We shouldn't slow initial load time for this reason. Another reason to get a server.
- Since I'm no longer using templates I can remove the dependency on the mustache templating engine

Backwards compatability
- You're building a new age site with videos and scroll events out the whazoo, you should
- There is something really ugly about any sort of browser detection.

Bad square code
- This was simply inexperience and lack of research. I didn't think about how much I was going to be impacting browser performance with this kind of code.

function createHeaderSquares() {
  var width = $("#intro-cover header").width() / NUM_HEADER_COLUMNS;
  var numRows = Math.ceil(wh / width);

  for (var i = 0; i < NUM_HEADER_COLUMNS * numRows; i++) {
    var square = $("<div>", {class: "square"});
    square.css({
      "width" :  width + "px",
      "height" :  width + "px",
    });
    $("#intro-cover header").append(square);
    squareList.push(square);

    numSquares++;
  };

  squareList = shuffle(squareList);
}

function resizeHeaderSquares() {
    var width = $("#intro-cover header").width() / NUM_HEADER_COLUMNS;
    var numRows = Math.ceil($("#intro-cover header").height() / width);

    if (numSquares != (NUM_HEADER_COLUMNS * numRows)) {
      for (var i = squareList.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        squareList[i].width(width).height(width);
      };

      while (numSquares < (NUM_HEADER_COLUMNS * numRows)) {
        for (var i = 0; i < (NUM_HEADER_COLUMNS * numRows) - numSquares; i++) {
          var square = $("<div>", {class: "square"});
          square.css({
            "width" :  width + "px",
            "height" :  width + "px",
          });

          $("#intro-cover header").append(square);
          squareList.push(square);
          numSquares++;
        }
        squareList = shuffle(squareList);
      }
    }

    setLogoSquaresBackground("transparent");
}

becomes...
.square {
    width: 5%;
    float: left;
    &:after {
      content: '';
      display: block;
      padding-bottom: 100%;
    }
}


Wait to load
- Shouldn't be necessary. If anything it should be a loading screen.


Bad meta tag:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
Sometimes people need to zoom in. No reason to deny them the right. The site is responsive after all.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
is sufficient

I'm using the bootstrap css unecessarily. I remember I was getting around to pulling it out but I got pulled off the task.

absurd nesting with less

You don't want to be sending mobile phones the video at all.

Although cool, I don't think it's necessary to change the layout of the team section for mobile.

Pixelation can use web workers, there is no need to block the main thread with that sort of work.

I pulled out my trusty web dev timeline tool and started recording. I found that most of my computation spikes were generated by recalculating the page layout. 
This is probably because I'm handling most of my responsive tasks in javascript.
Make layout better, get a fast page. Simple as that.

One idea for this was to use the 'vh' and 'vw' css units for the top sections.


Just by doing these small changes I dropped the critical rendering path from

Load time from ~5.25 seconds down to ~1.50 seconds
123 Requests -> 92 Requests
5.5 MB -> 4.1 MB

Next Steps:
Cleaning up LESS / CSS so you can actually read the damn thing
- I will be leveraging mixins

Moving Pixelation
